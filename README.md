# OpenCore Hackintosh Build for Dell Inspiron 5559 Laptop Private

This project will include complete guide to install MacOS Catalina on Dell Inspiron 5559 with i3 6th gen. It will also include a general guide to create own hackintosh build from scratch. Later i will include a complete youtube visual guide for the same.

Any internal hardware is not modified at all. All are preinstalled by DELL at the time of purchase.

1.Go to the link: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/

2.Try to read it carefully. If you have exact same laptop like me no need to read. You can paste my EFI folder and skip the EFI creation part of the guide.

3.After complete installation you can face this 2 issues: 

a) if you plug wired headset with headphone jack then you will face distorted sound

b) if you try to plug external monitor with HDMI then there will be no output. You will face no connection issue.
                                                          
4.To solve these 2 issues you just need to sleep and wake once after a fresh start each time.
